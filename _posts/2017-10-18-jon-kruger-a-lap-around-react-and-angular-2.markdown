React and Angular 2 are getting a lot of buzz these days, but how do
you decide which one to use? I took a small Rails app that I have in
production and rewrote it using both Angular 2 and React. I’ll show
you the code for the different versions, which will cover project
setup, routing, validation, view syntax, JSX, handling query string
parameters, managing state, Redux, Redux reducers, hot reloading,
and testing. I’ll go over some pros and cons and things I like/don’t
like that might help you decide which way to go.
