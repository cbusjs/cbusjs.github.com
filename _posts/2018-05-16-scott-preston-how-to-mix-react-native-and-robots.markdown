title: "Robots Powered By React Native"
speaker: "Scott Preston"
---

Have an old phone or tablet? Don't sell it, run a robot. While the phone platform is much more restrictive than Raspberry Pi, but it's also much simpler. Additionally it provides a great screen, a touch interface, sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes and a compass, a high resolution camera, a microphone, a speaker, Bluetooth and WiFi.

This talk will give an overview of React Native, and how to use React Native to control a robot and give it all the previously mentioned capabilities. Want to do more advanced things with your robot like adding cloud based AI, this talk will talk about that as well. As always Scott will bring a robot or two and demo the code live during the talk.

[Scott Preston](http://www.scottpreston.com/) is an engineer, developer and entrepreneur from Columbus, Ohio. Scott enjoys making things that run on JavaScript. Whether it's a robot, a smart home, or an Iron Man suit, Scott always has a story to tell. He's been speaking about robotics, artificial intelligence or JavaScript since 2005 at local user groups or national conferences, including a local favorite, [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/).

Scott's currently working as an independent consultant focusing on JavaScript Technologies and Cloud.
