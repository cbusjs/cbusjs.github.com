[Twitter has spoken](https://twitter.com/guyroyse/status/1244700396448296961) and a solid hour or BeardCam it is. However, it was a trick! Whenever I'm on camera, it's BeardCam!

The number two choice was to live-code on [RedisMUD](https://github.com/guyroyse/redis-mud). So, that's what we'll be doing. I'll be working with Node and RedisGraph. Tests will be written inusing Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.

The meeting [will be streamed](https://www.twitch.tv/ColumbusJS) on Twitch and there'll be a Zoom session going as well so y'all can interact with me while I code. Links to the Zoom will be on Meetup when you RSVP. So, please [go and do that](https://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/events/hlrxxqybcgbtb/)!

Like the rest of the world, we're online only right now. As a result, the previously scheduled speaker is not able to make the meetup. I'm planning on filling in. We've got a couple choices here:

- I live-code RedisMUD using WebSockets, Node.js, and RedisGraph.
- I give a talk called "Understanding Probabilistic Data Structures with 112,092 UFO Sightings".
- I brush and oil my beard for an hour.

Alternatively, if someone else would like to speak, I'd be happy to schedule you. Just drop me a line at guy at guy royse dot com (but, you know as an actual email address and not this bot shielding stuff).

Thanks,
Guy
