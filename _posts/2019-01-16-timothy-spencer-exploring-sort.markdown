title: "Lightning Talk: Exploring the sort Method in JavaScript"
speaker: "Timothy Spencer"
---

In some languages a ```sort``` method works on all primitive data types right out of the box. In JavaScript this is not the case - the ```sort``` method yields unexpected results with numeric data types. This is because the ```sort``` method in JavaScript converts everything to a string and then compares all values as strings.

Timothy is recent graduate from Columbus State with an interest in JavaScript and .NET.
