Jason Karns will talk about why we don't really need all these build tools and should instead give npm scripts a try.

Check out these articles: [Why we should stop using Grunt & Gulp](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/) and [How to Use npm as a Build Tool](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/), both by Keith Cirkel.
