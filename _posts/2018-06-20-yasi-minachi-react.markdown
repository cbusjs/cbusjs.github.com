title: "React: Writing Clean, Readable, Front-End Applications"
speaker: "Yasi Minachi"
---

Writing clean, readable, front-end applications is often a challenge, and there are tons of frameworks and libraries that seek to solve this problem. One of the fastest growing solutions out there today is React. Developed by Facebook, React (and its companion library, Redux) is a highly scalable and elegant solution to many of javascript's UI challenges. This talk will focus on the basics of how to get started in React, as well as some of the ideas behind writing clean and scalable React applications, and how to implement those ideas in large UI projects. It will also cover Redux, a state management library also developed by Facebook and built to work well with React applications.

Yasi Minachi is a software developer at [Pillar Technology](https://pillartechnology.com/), and has been writing code professionally for six years in an eclectic mix of different languages, frameworks, and projects, both front and back-end. In her spare time, she likes playing board games, indoor rock climbing, and exploring new things to do in Columbus.
