title: "Chrome Developer Tools: Raiding the Armory"
speaker: "Greg Malcolm"
---

The Chrome Developer Tools are absolutely packed with features. Some are incredibly useful. Some are just plain
surprising. For example: Turn the browser into an editor, fuzzy search source filenames, display data in the console in
tabular format and much, much more. In this session, we will fix up the storefront for Wacky Wanda’s Wicked Weapons and
learn some console wizardry in the process. In the course of our tribulations we will correct styling problems, enhance
our debugging skills, and clean up server-side snafus.

[Greg Malcolm](https://twitter.com/gregmalcolm) is an Application Developer/Consultant working for
[ICC](https://icctechnology.com/). He is a polyglot developer who loves experimenting with new languages and frameworks.
In recent years he's been focussing more and more on Javascript related frameworks. If you’re wondering about the
accent, everyone speaks like this in the southern foothills of Columbus.
