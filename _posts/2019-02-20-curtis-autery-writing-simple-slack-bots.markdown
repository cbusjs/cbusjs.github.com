This talk will cover the basics of talking to the Slack API with a handful of Node libraries: node-fetch, ws, and express. I'll show some incremental examples for building a (zombie horror) Choose-your-own-adventure app, and how the building blocks used for that can be extended to build a productivity app, namely an iCalendar processor that gives in-channel notifications when meetings are about to start.

We'll cover:

  - Creating personal Slack teams
  - Granting auth to a new app
  - Using await/fetch with bearer tokens for simple data collection and message posting
  - Using WebSockets for real-time messaging
  - Callbacks and triggers from user button clicks
  - Registering slash commands
  - Surviving the zombie apocalypse

Curtis Autery is a software engineer at Beam Dental, campus instructor for Girls Who Code, runs a [coding club](https://appsbykids.org/) at Graham Expeditionary Middle School, and is an occasional speaker and mentor for the Columbus freeCodeCamp chapter.
