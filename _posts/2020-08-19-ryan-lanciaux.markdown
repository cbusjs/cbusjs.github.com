Webpack is an excellent tool for bundling web applications for the browser. The advancements that bundling a web application unlocked propelled frontend applications to where they are today. If you‚Äôre building a production application with JavaScript, it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôre using Webpack. But what if you could ship your applications without using a bundler? What if you could write applications with better performance and less developer overhead?

In this talk we‚Äôll Explore Snowpack ‚Äî an exciting tool that lets web developers "Bundle because you want to, not because you need to.‚Äù We‚Äôll see how we can write applications using modern, ECMAScript Modules (ESM) natively in the web without a build step. From there, we‚Äôll add more advanced tooling like TypeScript and light bundle step. At the end of this talk, you‚Äôll be a bit more familiar with some of the native browser capabilities for modern JavaScript and some of the performance implications that bundlers can have on our apps.
