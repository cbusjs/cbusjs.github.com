It seems like every day a new JavaScript framework is created. It can be
overwhelming to keep up with all of them. This session will discuss some
JavaScript packages that will make analyzing and displaying data a snap. We
will discuss D3.js, CrossFilter.js, DC.js and jQuery DataTables. These are
very robust community supported libraries. Use them in your client application
to add interactive visualizations and data analysis tools.
