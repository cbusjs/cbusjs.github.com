title: "JavaScript Modules - RequireJS vs Browserify"
speaker: "Jeff Valore"

Anyone who has written JavaScript knows how easy it is for the code to become a big ugly unmaintainable mess. Let's stop dumping code into one big file, mixing responsibilities, and putting everything in global scope! JavaScript modules can help us keep our code clean, maintainable and testable. RequireJS and Browserify are the two most popular JavaScript module loading frameworks. They serve a similar purpose, but have drastically different implementations. In this talk we will introduce JavaScript modules, and compare the features and drawbacks of RequireJS and Browserify. Which one is right for your next project?
