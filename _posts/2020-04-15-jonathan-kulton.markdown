title: "ðŸ›¸ Mothership: Building a PaaS with Node.js and Docker"
speaker: "Jonathan Kulton"
---

Platforms as a service like Heroku and Google App Engine provide a means of deploying applications while abstracting away the need to manage infrastructure. The developer provides their source code and minimal configuration and the platform builds, runs, and hosts their application. How do platforms like this work, and how are they built?

Jon Kulton will share how he and a small team created Mothership, an open source and self-hosted platform as a service. Mothership enables teams to easily deploy and manage small, internal applications. It is written in Node.js, and uses a distributed, multi-tenant architecture. This talk will outline the challenges the team faced in developing an open source platform as a service, and how they solved them.
