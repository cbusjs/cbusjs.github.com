It's a common misconception that Design Systems are for designers. While this is true, they are just as much, if not more for developers. Design Systems are a collaboration tool to increase communication and reduce the time to market for your products. We will talk about what Design Systems are and how you can begin using them today.

Burton Smith has been building software and applications for over 10 years and focuses primarily on web and mobile software engineering. At his current company, he works with internal business stakeholders and external customers to build digital products.

In his free time, he loves spending time with his wife and three daughters, practicing martial arts, jamming on his ukulele, and learning new things (usually about software engineering).
