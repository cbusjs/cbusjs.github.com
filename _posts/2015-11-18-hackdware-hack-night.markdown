---

Hack! Share! Learn! We'll be joining forces with the Arduino & Raspberry Pi
Enthusiasts group to have another Hack Night.

[Scott Preston](http://www.scottpreston.com/) will be bringing impressive
things as he is wont to do. [Guy Royse](http://guyroyse.com/) will be prepared
to build ridiculous stuff with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/),
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/).

You should bring something too!
