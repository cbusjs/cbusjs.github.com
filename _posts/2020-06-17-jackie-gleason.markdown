We live in a builderâ€™s paradise, a world of 3d printers and massive batteries. One where amazing products such as Arduino and Raspberry PI provide amazing abilities. Now imagine doing all of this in Javascript! We will use Node to call native C modules that can communicate directly to GPIO pins. We will also look at how libraries such as node-serial can be used to easily communicate with Arduinos and other platforms. All of this will follow the [pi-serial-example](https://github.com/jrgleason/pi-serial-example) github project. So join us and learn how to embrace our robotic overlords.
