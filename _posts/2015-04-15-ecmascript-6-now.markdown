ECMAScript most famous dialect is JavaScript, and the coming version is
ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Browsers already started supporting some of its features.
JS programmers need to start learning about the coming changes. The presentation
will show some of ES6 most useful features like classes, block scope,
collections, proxies, arrow functions, iterators, generators, comprehensions,
and modules. We will concentrate on the practical aspects of the changes. The
session will be interactive, includes many code examples, and will encourage
audience participation. By the end of the presentation, participants will know
when and how to use ES6 in their own projects.
