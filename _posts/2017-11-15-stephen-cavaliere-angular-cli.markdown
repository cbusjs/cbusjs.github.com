Have you ever wanted to get started with an Angular application? Have you struggled with where to go next after you
cloned one of the many seed projects? Look no further! This talk will cover the official Angular CLI which will create
a production-ready single page application with just a few commands. From generating a skeleton project to deploying to
production, the CLI is with you every step of the way. Come see why the CLI is becoming the tool to use to build your
Angular projects.
