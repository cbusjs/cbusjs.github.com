By popular request, Guy will be introducing everyone to WebAssembly.

"What is WebAssembly?" you say. According to [WebAssembly.org](https://webassembly.org/):

> WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

Guy will introduce you to the concepts of Wasm and then dive right into code. All the examples will be live coded and written in the WebAssembly text format. Yes, we will be live coding in assembly language. These samples will then be compiled using command-line tools and then called from JavaScript in the browser.

So get ready for a truly deep dive into a hot new technology.
