Today‚Äôs fast-moving software delivery environment emphasizes pushing value to production as quickly as possible. ‚ÄúValue to production‚Äù implicitly requires high quality‚Äîlow quality is of little value to anyone! ‚Äîwhich means teams need to focus on being able to specify, build, test, and deploy software effectively and quickly. Acceptance testing historically been manually intensive efforts run by a dedicated QA department, resulting in a slower pace of production releases.

No longer do we have to make acceptance a manual effort that requires a dedicated QA department. With the release of Cypress, we have a new standard in front-end testing that allows every developer to create acceptance tests. Come learn how you can create fast, easy, and reliable test for anything that runs in a browser regardless of the front-end framework used.

You will walk away ready to end the era of ‚ÄúDevelopers don‚Äôt write acceptance tests‚Äù and start writing acceptance tests for all of your projects.
