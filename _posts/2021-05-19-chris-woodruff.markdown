Imagine, if you will, your Manager asks you to develop a new desktop application. You’re so used to web development that you don’t know how to get started. What should you do? Dig out your old VB 6 books or learn a new technology? Better yet, keep those web skills and use Electron. Electron is the cross-platform application shell GitHub built initially for the Atom editor. The focus of this talk will allow you to leave with the starting skills to set up your development environment, generate your starter project, and build some business logic. Chris Woodruff will be your guide to leveraging your valuable skills for the desktop.

Chris Woodruff AKA Woody is the Team Leader for Developer Relations at Quicken Loans, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, which is based in Detroit, Michigan.
