We'll not be having our regular meeting in December. Instead, we'll have a holiday party with all the other meetups in town. More details to come including a code so you can attend for free!

MORE DETAILS:

Here's the link to the event: [https://cbusholidayparty2019.eventbrite.com](https://cbusholidayparty2019.eventbrite.com)

For technologists (i.e. a developer who just wants to attend) there is a $9.99 fee, which is already a steal! However, if you enter the promo code **cbusjsftw** then they'll waive that fee.
